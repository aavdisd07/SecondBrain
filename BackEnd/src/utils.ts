/*
Notes:
1. This function generates a random string by selecting random characters from a predefined set.
2. Avoid creating a `utils.ts` file to store miscellaneous functions or data without clear organization.
   - Storing unrelated or arbitrary functions and data in `utils.ts` is considered a bad practice.
   - Instead, organize functions into specific modules or files based on their purpose and usage.
3. Always aim for clean and modular code structure to improve maintainability and readability.
